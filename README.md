`tonal` is a music theory library. Contains functions to manipulate tonal
elements of music (note, intervals, chords, scales, modes, keys). It deals with
abstractions (not actual music or sound).

`tonal` is implemented in Typescript and published as a collection of Javascript
npm packages.

It uses a functional programing style: all functions are pure, there is no data
mutation, and entities are represented by data structures instead of objects.

## Example

```js
import { Interval, Note, Scale } from "tonal";

Note.midi("A4"); // => 60
Note.freq("a4").freq; // => 440
Note.accidentals("c#2"); // => '#'
Note.transpose("C4", "5P"); // => "G4"
Interval.semitones("5P"); // => 7
Interval.distance("C4", "G4"); // => "5P"

// Scales
Scale.get("C major").notes; // => ["C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "A", "B"];
[1, 3, 5, 7].map(Scale.degrees("C major")); // => ["C", "E", "G", "B"]

Chord.get("Cmaj7").name; // => "C major seventh"

// Chord inversions
const triad = Chord.degrees("Cm");
[1, 2, 3].map(triad); // => ["C", "Eb", "G"];
[2, 3, 4].map(triad); // => ["Eb", "G", "C"];
[3, 4, 5].map(triad); // => ["G", "C", "Eb"];
```

## Install

Install all packages at once:

```bash
npm install --save tonal
```

## Usage

Tonal is compatible with both ES5 and ES6 modules, and browser.

#### ES6 `import`:

```js
import { Note, Scale } from "tonal";
```

#### ES5 `require`:

```js
const { Note, Scale } = require("tonal");
```

#### Browser

You can use the browser version from jsdelivr CDN directly in your html:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tonal/browser/tonal.min.js"></script>
<script>
  console.log(Tonal.Key.minorKey("Ab"));
</script>
```

Or if you prefer, grab the
[minified browser ready version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonaljs/tonal/master/packages/tonal/browser/tonal.min.js)
from the repository.

#### Bundle size

`tonal` includes all published modules.

Although the final bundle it is small, you can
reduce bundle sizes even more by installing the modules individually, and
importing only the functions you need.

Note that individual modules are prefixed with `@tonaljs/`. For example:

```bash
npm i @tonaljs/note
```

```js
import { transpose } from "@tonaljs/note";
transpose("A4", "P5");
```

## Documentation

Generally, you just need to install `tonal` package (before it was called `@tonaljs/tonal`).

The API documentation is inside README.md of each module ðŸ‘‡

- [@tonaljs/interval](/packages/interval): Interval operations (add, simplify,
  invert)
- [@tonaljs/pitch-notation-abc](/packages/pitch-notation-abc): Parse ABC
  notation notes

#### Scales and chords

- [@tonaljs/scale](/packages/scale): Scales
- [@tonaljs/scale-type](/packages/scale-type): A dictionary of scales
- [@tonaljs/chord](/packages/chord): Chords

- [@tonaljs/pcset](/packages/pcset): Pitch class sets. Compare note groups.

#### Keys, chord progressions

Read [contributing document](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). To contribute open a PR and ensure:

- If is a music theory change (like the name of a scale) link to reliable references.
- If is a new feature, add documentation: changes to README of the affected module(s) are expected.
- Ad tests: changes to the test.ts file of the affected module(s) are expected.
- All tests are green
