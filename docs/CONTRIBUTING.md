You will need node and yarn installed on your computer to run the code. And git to download it:

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Download the code

To download the code, use git:

## Development

Modules are written in Typescript and live inside `packages/` folder.

Some guidelines:

- If you are adding new functionality to a current module, please add a test for it.
- Ensure all tests passes and library can be built, before making a pull request: `yarn test:ci`

#### How to add a new module

To create a new module:

- Add a new folder inside packages: `packages/my-module`
- Add a new package.json inside the folder (see any of them as an example)
- Add required dependencies to "dependencies" inside package.json. Ensure correct dependency versions. For example, if your module needs to use `tonal/core` look at core's package.json to see what version to use
- After adding your dependencies, use lerna to wire them up: run `yarn lerna` at root folder
- Add your functionallity and tests
- Ensure everything works: run `yarn test:ci` at root folder
- Create a pull request
